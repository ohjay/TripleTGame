# TripleTGame
Triple T, aka Kirby: The Tedhaun Treaty. Currently in a state of development, playable only by downloading and compiling all of the files and subsequently running the command `java TripleT/TripleT` from the topmost directory.

## Development Timeline
Note that this is not contractually binding. I cannot be sued if I do not hold to the below schedule... at least, I think I can't.

- [By **12/18/15 @ 11:59pm**] Animation and enemy classes complete; working ver. of kirbySMASH
- [By **12/23/15 @ 11:59pm**] World 1 complete, incl. cutscenes
- [By **12/30/15 @ 11:59pm**] World 2 complete, incl. cutscenes
- [By **12/31/15 @ 11:59pm**] Options, cutscenes, and overall application complete

## Features & Functionality
Here's a quick listing of what you can expect:

- A story mode, styled as a traditional Kirby platformer (with some twists)
- Two minigames:
  - **Dodge!**: A Tedhaun evasion game
  - **kirbySMASH**: A Super Smash Bros-inspired fighter game
- Control customization
- Automatic game progress/high score retention
- Options [to change sprite colors and volume]
- Animated cutscenes that appear before major events in the storyline

## TIL
If I had used a framework or a game engine (ex. Unity) instead of writing everything from scratch, this all would have been a lot easier and probably better quality too. Still – it's about the journey, right?

## Contributors
If you'd like to join the team, you're in luck – we may just have a place for you! Either submit a pull request that's worthy of our acceptance (hint: not that hard... I think!), or [send Owen an email](mailto:owenjow@berkeley.edu) with a description of what you could bring to the table. Or just send Owen an email, period. (I'm trying not to sound desperate here, but it's a lot of work to make a from-scratch game!)

For now, this is who we've got:

- Owen Jow [development, design]
- William Jow [graphics and aesthetics]
