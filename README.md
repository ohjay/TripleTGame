# TripleTGame
Triple T, aka Kirby: The Tedhaun Treaty. Currently in a state of development, playable only by downloading and compiling all of the files and subsequently running the command `java TripleT/TripleT` from the topmost directory.

  - **Dodge!**: A Tedhaun evasion game
  - **kirbySMASH**: A Super Smash Bros-inspired fighter game
- Control customization
- Automatic game progress/high score retention
