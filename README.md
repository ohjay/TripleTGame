# TripleTGame
Triple T, aka Kirby: The Tedhaun Treaty. Currently in a state of development, playable only by downloading and compiling all of the files and subsequently running the command `java TripleT/TripleT` from the topmost directory.

At present, there exists functionality only for the main menu, a minigame called Dodge!, and the credits screen. However, stay tuned for more updates! They'll be good, I ~~promise~~ hope.

**Update [8/5/15]: A playable demo should be available within the next two months!**
