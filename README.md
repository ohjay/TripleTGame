Dodge
========================================================================

A downloadable Kirby-based evasion game written in Java. This game was originally part of [TripleT](https://github.com/ohjay/TripleTGame). However, due to the long development process that awaits TripleT before its finished version, Dodge was released as a standalone demo.


Download
------------------------------------------------------------------------

You can download Dodge as an executable JAR file by clicking [here](https://github.com/ohjay/Dodge/blob/master/Dodge.jar?raw=true). The file is 42.3 MB. Once the download is complete, the game can be run simply by double-clicking on Dodge.jar in the filesystem.


Gameplay
------------------------------------------------------------------------

The rules of the game are simple: dodge ghosts (formally known as [Tedhauns](http://kirby.wikia.com/wiki/Tedhaun)) and collect as many treasure chests as you can before the ghosts/Tedhauns overwhelm you! However, the more treasure you collect, the more ghosts you will attract. Therefore, as the game progresses you will find it harder and harder to survive. 

However, you do have one thing on your side: power-ups. With the press of a button, you can transform into Star Kirby, who emits the white-hot passion of a thousand burning suns! The passion is too much for the ghosts: if Star Kirby comes into contact with them, they will vanish and go off to haunt someone else. Nevertheless, stars do not last forever... and since Kirby is a much smaller (and brighter) star than most, his supply of hydrogen fuel will run out especially quickly. When this happens, Kirby will revert to his normal form. And life will continue.

Here's a visual of Dodge gameplay:

Controls
------------------------------------------------------------------------

This game is controlled entirely by the keyboard; menu navigation is primarily tied to the arrow keys and ENTER. Default controls are as follows:

- **Left (move, switch menu options)**: the left arrow key
- **Right (move, switch menu options):** the right arrow key
- **Up (move, switch menu options)**: the up arrow key
- **Down (move, switch menu options)**: the down arrow key
- **Power up (in-game)**: A
- **Pause (in-game)**: SHIFT
- **Select a menu option**: ENTER
- **Go back**: DELETE

Instructions for customizing controls:

1. Start the program.
2. On the main menu, select the "controls" option and hit ENTER.
3. You will be taken to the controls menu. The control that is highlighted is the one for which you are currently changing. Hit the key that you want to be associated with that control. (ex. if "LEFT" is highlighted and you want to move left with the left arrow key, press the left arrow key.)
4. The box on the right will reflect the change and the next control will now be highlighted. In the same fashion, press the key that should be associated with that control.
5. Continue in this way until you have chosen a key for every control. Then hit any button to return to the main menu.
6. If you make a mistake, you will have to repeat the selection process for all six controls (in other words, starting from #2 on these instructions).
