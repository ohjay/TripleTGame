# TripleTGame
Triple T, aka Kirby: The Tedhaun Treaty. Currently in a state of development, playable only by downloading and compiling all of the files and subsequently running the command "java TripleT/TripleT" from the topmost directory.

At present, there exists functionality only for the main menu, a minigame called Dodge!, and the credits screen. However, stay tuned for more updates! They'll be good, I ~~promise~~ hope.
